ðŸ§  Market Rhythm Toolkit

A modular, behaviorally-driven framework for analyzing intraday market structure using gap classification, session segmentation, and bid/ask imbalance dynamics. This toolkit is designed for traders and researchers seeking structural clarity, behavioral transparency, and empirical validation across trading sessions.

ðŸ“¦ Repository Contents

1. gap_session_flow.ipynb
Builds a 3-stage behavioral funnel:

Gap Type: Classifies sessions based on 07:00 and 09:30 opens relative to prior range.

Session Classification: Tags overlapping vs non-overlapping range structure.

Close Behavior: Identifies closes inside vs outside prior range.

Outputs:

Joint probabilities across all flows

Conditional bar charts and pie grids

Flow scoring and ratio analysis

2. bair_tpo_dashboard.ipynb
Generates a 7-panel dashboard for any session:

Traditional time-based TPO (prev PIT)

Volume and BAIR TPOs (pre-market, full session, PIT)

Candlestick chart with shaded POCs

Cumulative BAIR trace for PIT session

Supports:

Visual regime segmentation

Sentiment tracking via BAIR

Structural validation of reversal zones

3. daily_tpo_summary.py
Extracts daily reference levels:

Traditional TPO metrics (POC, VAH, VAL, High/Low)

Volume and BAIR POCs across session slices

Outputs a clean summary DataFrame for regime tagging or dashboard integration

ðŸ§  Behavioral Philosophy
This toolkit is built on the belief that market structure tells a story â€” and that story can be segmented, scored, and validated. Each module is:

Modular: Designed for reuse and extension

Empirical: Grounded in observable session logic

Transparent: Outputs are interpretable and visually verifiable

ðŸš€ Future Extensions
Rhythm engine with adaptive regime tagging

Interactive Dash dashboard for flow exploration

Behavioral scoring and clustering

Session memory and transition mapping

ðŸ“š Getting Started
Clone the repo and install dependencies (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

Run gap_session_flow.ipynb to explore behavioral funnels

Use bair_tpo_dashboard.ipynb to visualize any session

Call summarize_daily_tpo_with_traditional() to extract reference levels
